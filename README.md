# Disease Prediction from Symptom Checker using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a web-based Symptom Checker application that utilizes Machine Learning to predict potential diseases based on user-entered symptoms. The Symptom Checker assists users in understanding possible health conditions they might be facing, providing them with valuable information and guiding them towards seeking professional medical advice when necessary.

## Features

- *User-Friendly Interface*: The application offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface that allows users to easily input their symptoms.

- *Symptom Analysis*: The system analyzes the entered symptoms and processes them through a machine learning model.

- *Disease Prediction*: Using the processed data, the system predicts potential diseases or health conditions associated with the symptoms.

- *Informative Results*: Users receive detailed information about the predicted diseases, including common symptoms, risk factors, and general advice.

- *Privacy and Security*: The system ensures the privacy and security of user data, adhering to data protection regulations.

## Technology Stack

- *Frontend*: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js
- *Backend*: Python, Flask
- *Machine Learning*: Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch
- *Database*: SQLite or MongoDB
- *API Integration*: NHS API or WebMD API
- *Deployment*: AWS, Azure, or Heroku
